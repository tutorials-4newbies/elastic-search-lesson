 on 6 April 2014 // Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year, even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By

But it's very much alike to a 00 gauge. But this train set isn't an add-on for an electric train set nor has nothing to do with one.I bought this for my 4 year old nephew as he adores trains but is far too young for an electric set. He was VERY happy with this though! | what is the layout of the tracks? // Its an oval shape layout","**Highly Recommended!** // 5.0 // 26 May 2015 // By

 on 26 May 2015 // Simple & GREAT FUN for 5+My nephews face was amazing when he opened this for his birthday!! His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains. This gets them started in the hobby and doesn't cost much at all! | Excellent product // 5.0 // 29 Jun. 2014 // By
